The Chemosynth Lab Simulator is a web-based application designed for simulating and visualizing the effects of various parameters on biomass production and energy output in a chemosynthetic environment. Users can input key parameters such as temperature, H2S concentration, and efficiency to run simulations and analyze results through graphical representations. Key Features: User-Friendly Interface: The application features an intuitive and visually appealing interface that allows users to easily input parameters and run simulations. Input Parameters: Users can specify the following parameters: Temperature (°C): The operating temperature for the simulation. H2S Concentration (mmol/L): The concentration of hydrogen sulfide in the environment. Efficiency (0-1): A value representing the efficiency of the biomass production process. Simulation Execution: Upon clicking the "Run Simulation" button, the application calculates key metrics based on the provided inputs and predefined default values (e.g., pressure, pH, maintenance energy, and energy content). Calculations: The application performs calculations to derive the following outputs: Energy Yield (ΔG): A measure of the energy yield based on the inputs. Biomass Production (BP): The amount of biomass produced in grams per square meter per day. Energy Output (EO): The total energy output in joules per square meter per day. Graphical Representation: The application displays graphs that show: Biomass Production vs. Temperature: Illustrating how biomass production varies with temperature changes. Energy Output vs. Pressure: Demonstrating the relationship between energy output and pressure variations. These graphs help users visualize trends and patterns in the simulation results. Dynamic Results Display: After running a simulation, results are presented in a pop-up window, displaying ranges of biomass production and energy output derived from the simulation. Aesthetic Design: The application features a modern design with a dark blue transparent background and visually distinct elements, enhancing user engagement and usability. Technologies Used: Frontend: HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap for styling), JavaScript (using Chart.js for graphs). Backend: Node.js (for handling server requests and simulations). Target Users: This application is intended for researchers, educators, and students in the fields of environmental science, biology, and chemistry who are interested in understanding the dynamics of chemosynthetic processes and biomass production. Overall, the Chemosynth Lab Simulator serves as a powerful educational tool, providing users with hands-on experience in simulating and analyzing biological processes in a user-friendly online environment.
