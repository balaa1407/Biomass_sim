The Chemosynth Lab Simulator is an online tool that helps people understand how different conditions affect the production of biomass (living matter) and energy in environments where chemosynthesis happens. Chemosynthesis is a process where organisms produce energy without sunlight, often in deep-sea ecosystems.

What It Does:
Input Settings: Users can adjust three key settings:

Temperature (how hot it is).
H2S Concentration (amount of hydrogen sulfide available, a key ingredient for chemosynthesis).
Efficiency (how well the organisms convert energy into biomass).
Run Simulations: After entering these values, users press a button to calculate:

Energy Yield: How much energy the process produces.
Biomass Production: How much living matter is created.
Energy Output: Total energy produced per day.
View Results: The tool shows the results as numbers and in graphs:

Biomass vs. Temperature: How changes in temperature affect biomass production.
Energy Output vs. Pressure: How energy output is influenced by pressure (preset in the tool).
Visual Design: The app is easy to use, with a clear layout, graphs, and a modern look to make the experience enjoyable.
